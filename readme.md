# AI Snake Game

## Project Overview

The AI Snake Game is a Python-based application that leverages deep learning techniques to train a snake to play the game autonomously. Using PyTorch and a custom reinforcement learning algorithm, the snake learns to navigate the game environment, avoid collisions, and maximize its score.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes a Q-learning model with a neural network to decide the snake's direction.
- **Customizable Training Episodes**: Configure the number of training episodes and batch size.
- **Real-time Training Visualization**: Visual output of the snake's movements and score as it learns.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Pygame
